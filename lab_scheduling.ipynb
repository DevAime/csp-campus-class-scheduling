    "## Concept of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)\n",
    "\n",
    "CSPs (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) are search problems where the solution must satisfy a set of constraints. The problem is framed as a collection of variables, each with a set of possible values (domains), and a collection of constraints that restrict the values the variables can take simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is powerful in situations where we must make optimal or feasible decisions given limited resources or rules — like scheduling, assignment, or planning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of CSP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables:** These are the unknowns we are solving for. In a scheduling problem, they can represent elements like time slots, locations, or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domains:** Each variable has a domain — a set of values it can take. For example, a time slot variable might have a domain of 7 possible time blocks in a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraints:** These are the rules that must be respected. They ensure the feasibility of the final assignment. Constraints can be:\n",
    "  - **Hard constraints**, which must be strictly satisfied (e.g., no faculty can teach two classes at the same time).\n",
    "  - **Soft constraints**, which are desirable but not mandatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSP solver uses these constraints, along with heuristics, to reduce the search space and find a feasible solution efficiently.\n"

    "## Problem Statement: Laboratory Scheduling at UISU-A\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to design a weekly laboratory schedule for **5 laboratories** in the LKB Building at **UISU-Africa**. Our university offers **200 classes per semester**, taught by **60 faculty members**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To automate this process, we adopted a **Constraint Satisfaction Programming (CSP)** approach, implemented using **Google OR-Tools**, a robust library for constraint solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we considered using the `constraint` Python library, but we found it ineffective for scaling and handling the complexity of the problem. Hence, we transitioned to using `ortools.sat.python.cp_model`, which proved more efficient and flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Our program takes input from an Excel file named `classes_input2.xlsx` with the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: Unique class identifier (e.g., DSA2020)\n",
    "- `faculty`: ID of the faculty member assigned to teach the class (0–59)\n",
    "- `is_concentration`: Whether the class is a concentration course (1 for yes, 0 for no)\n",
    "- `is_double`: Whether the class is a double session class (1 for yes, 0 for no)\n",
    "\n",
    "The program returns an output Excel file named `labo_schedule3.xlsx` with the complete lab schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables, Domain, and Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables:\n",
    "- **Lab** assigned to each class\n",
    "- **Time slot** for each class\n",
    "- **Day pair** (e.g., Mon/Wed, Tue/Thu, or single days)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domains:\n",
    "- **Lab:** Lab1 to Lab5\n",
    "- **Time slot:** 7 possible slots in a day\n",
    "- **Day pair:** 7 combinations of days (MonWed, TueThu, Mon, Tue, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints:\n",
    "1. **No time overlap for same-semester classes**\n",
    "2. **No faculty teaching more than one class at the same time**\n",
    "3. **Concentration classes must be held in smaller labs (Lab4 or Lab5)**\n",
    "4. **Double classes must be scheduled on Mon/Wed or Tue/Thu**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: While the university offers 200 classes, we reduced the number to **100** in our experiment due to performance limitations on our local machines.\n"

    "## Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We now walk through the implementation of our CSP model using OR-Tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code follows these major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reading and validating input data**\n",
    "2. **Creating decision variables for lab, timeslot, and daypair**\n",
    "3. **Defining hard constraints**\n",
    "4. **Adding special rules for concentration and double classes**\n",
    "5. **Solving the model using CP-SAT solver**\n",
    "6. **Exporting the resulting schedule to Excel**\n",
    "\n",
    "## GUI option\n",
    "To make our scheduling tool more accessible and user-friendly, we also developed a simple web application using Streamlit, which provides an interactive interface for uploading the course input file and downloading the generated schedule. The web app is implemented in the file named GUI.py. To run it, make sure the streamlit library is installed (pip install streamlit), and then execute the command streamlit run main2.py in your terminal. This will launch the app in your web browser, allowing you to use the scheduling system without interacting directly with the code.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the power of CSPs in solving real-world scheduling problems. Using OR-Tools, we modeled variables, defined their domains, and encoded institutional constraints to automatically generate a lab schedule that avoids conflicts and follows policy rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite initial performance limitations with other libraries and with large input sizes, our final approach is scalable and can be further optimized or extended to include soft constraints (like preferred times or faculty availability) in future versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab scheduling system can greatly ease administrative workload and improve scheduling efficiency at UISU-A.\n"
